labs_about: "Welcome to LiRA, where we focus on developing embodied AI agents. Unlike traditional passive AI systems, we specialize in crafting active AI agents capable of understanding and dynamically interacting with the physical world, much like humans do. Our goal extends to the seamless coexistence and collaboration between humans and robots, envisioning a future where these entities work harmoniously together. Drawing from an interdisciplinary toolkit, our research leverages methodologies from reinforcement learning, machine learning, deep learning, optimization, and probabilistic inference."
